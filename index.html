    <h1> Ketan Mittal</h1>
    <p> This is a quick description. This is specifically for the Spring 2025 DSC 106 Class where we will be learning Data Science Visualization. A quick introduction about me is that I am a current sophomore student at UCSD, studying Data Science and double minoring in Mathematics and Cognitive Science. </p>
